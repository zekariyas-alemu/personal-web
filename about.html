                    <h2>Hi, my name is ZEKARIYAS </h2>
                    <p>  I'm a student in AAIT I was born on a cold winter night, when even time seemed<br>
                       to stand still, in my native addis, ethiopia. I do not remember much of my early ch<br>
                       ildhood, but my mom said that I was a very active, curious, and communicative child.<br>
                       I would ask dozens of questions each minute, even without waiting for the answers. I<br>
                       suppose this is why i am so talkative. when I was at elementary school I was passion<br>
                       ate about science. This passion helped me gain profound knowledge in these areas, and<br>
                       I was admitted to the college of my dreams. Today, I am a student at aau in addis,and<br>
                       I feel very happy about it I am certain that my degree will become my ticket to a bet<br>
                       ter tomorrow. I want to become a renowned web designer in the field of information te<br>
                       chnology. I study hard and devote my free time to reading scholarly reviews and watch<br>
                       ing interviews with recognized specialists in the field.</p>
